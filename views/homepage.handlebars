                <h4>The year is 2012. The gainfully bearded citizens of Milton take to the streets, proudly showcasing their admiration for this great city through their wardrobe of tastefully designed crew neck t-shirts. They long for a place they can gather with friends and enjoy the excellence that is a well-crafted, locally sourced burger that doesn’t strive to reinvent the wheel. Through careful deliberation, HAMBRGR was born with a commitment to its city and a promise for all – to make the best damn burger you’ve ever eaten.</h4>
