Group Project 2:  A Restaurant Menu CMS 

## place holder 

## User Story 
As an owner of a chain of quick-service reastuaruants I would like to have an application that allows me to update menue items, and prices 
across different restauraunts. I would also like the ability to add new restaurnts as I grow my Empire. I will require my individual Restaurant Management teams to
have their own unique profiles to access their restaurant data. 

## acceptance criteria 
when I launch the app I am presented with a secure log in page
When i log in i am presented a clear menue where i am given the options to:
1) display all menue items 
2) search for existing menue items 
3) add menue items 
4) update existing menue items 
5) delete menue items 
6) assign menue items by store

I should also be able to display all the stores I own and be able to add new stores as I expand.
